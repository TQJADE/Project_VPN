# Project_VPN
<p>
  This is a <a href="http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Networking/VPN/">Internet Security Course Project</a>. It is a SSL-based VPN and the design and implementation of SSL VPNs exemplify a number of security principles and technologies, including crypto, integrity, authentication, key management, key exchange, and Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

<p>
  Future Plan:
  <li>Use Pipe to realize communication	between	UDP	process	and	TCP	process.</li>
  <li>Realize multiple TCP clients handling.</li>
  <li>Optimize the key exchange.</li>
